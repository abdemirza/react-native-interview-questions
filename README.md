### Example Answers

#### 1. What is React-Native?

React-Native is an open-source framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It was created by Facebook and is used by many popular apps, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Airbnb. React-Native allows developers to write code once and use it across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and web.

#### 2. What are the major features of React-Native?

Some of the major features of React-Native include:

- **Hot reloading:** With hot reloading, changes to the code are reflected immediately in the app, making it easier and faster to develop and debug.

- **Code reuse:** React-Native allows developers to write code once and use it across multiple platforms, which can save time and reduce development costs.

- **Native performance:** React-Native apps are built using native components, which means they have performance characteristics similar to those of apps built using native languages.

- **Third-party library support:** React-Native has a large and active community, which has created many third-party libraries and tools to help developers build and maintain their apps.

#### 3. What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. It is used in React to describe what the user interface of a component should look like. JSX makes it easier to write and read code by allowing developers to write HTML-like syntax, which is then compiled to JavaScript.
